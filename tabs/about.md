Hi, this is another blog of mine. Yap, I have a - mostly in portuguese - wordpress called [codemountain](http://codemountain.wordpress.com), and a [Posterous](http://posterous.com/paulosuzart). Maybe I move to here and kill the others. Don't know yet.

The main reason to starting blogging directly on my Github is to keep the subjects even more focused on projects committed here, and share some experiences with some libs also committed here.

I write code since 2004 and worked in a variety of industries and technologies. You can find an up to date CV on my LinkedIn.
