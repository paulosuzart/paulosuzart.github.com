    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I'm posting as often as the men go to the moon! Sad. For a good
reason, though. We are having great times at
<a href="http://www.guiato.com.br">Guiato</a>.</p>

<p>What I bring today is the set of tools I'm using nowadays for developing
Grails and Clojure at work.</p>

<h1>Editor (gVim with Janus)</h1>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublimetext</a> for almost two years at home and at work. I really like it, but if I understood well, the version 3 is available for purchasing only. And, you know, you have a <code>vim</code> editor. Why not?</p>

<p>Ok, pure <code>vi</code> is too much for most people, so put some sauce and you have
a Sublimetext like <code>vim</code> editor, or even more powerful. Just use <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> for it and combine with gVim.</p>

<p>It comes with nice color scheemes and lots of plugins. The plugins I use
more often are:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">CtrlP</a>. This is exactly like
 Control P at Sublime and allows you search your entire project.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>. Simply can't
 live without it. It is your project browser.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator">BufferGator</a>.
To browse between all your open buffers</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar">Tagbar</a>. The campion! This
is your code outlook similar to what popular IDEs offer.</li>
</ol>


<p>There is a nice support for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, but I stay at pure command line.</p>

<p>Get it up and running is fairly easy. Don't waste time, go set up yours.</p>

<p>Just a note: Tagbar works perfect for clojure, but I work mainly with
groovy and Grails, so you can set ctags to recognize <code>.groovy</code> content:</p>

<p><code>bash ctags for groovy
--langdef=groovy
--langmap=groovy:.groovy
--regex-groovy=/^[ \t]*[(private|public|protected) ( \t)]*[A-Za-z0-9_&lt;&gt;]+[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)[ \t]*\(.*\)[ \t]*{/\1/f,function,functions/
--regex-groovy=/^[ \t]*def[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)[ \t]*\=[ \t]*\{/\1/f,function,functions/
--regex-groovy=/^[ \t]*private def[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)[ \t]*/\1/v,private,private variables/
--regex-groovy=/^[ \t]*def[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)[ \t]*/\1/u,public,public variables/
--regex-groovy=/^[ \t]*[abstract ( \t)]*[(private|public) ( \t)]*class[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)[ \t]*/\1/c,class,classes/
--regex-groovy=/^[ \t]*[abstract ( \t)]*[(private|public) ( \t)]*enum[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)[ \t]*/\1/c,class,classes/
</code></p>

<h1>Search</h1>

<p>CtrlP is great, but you are not always with your vim open or with
your project open. For this, linux offers grep and find. But waht is
<a href="http://beyondgrep.com/">beyond grep</a>? There is <code>ack-grep</code>!</p>

<p>Believe me you'll love it. It is extremely practical, fast and developer
focused. So you don't even need to open gVim. Just seach, find edit and
commit!</p>

<p>The extra config for <code>ack-grep</code> is a new extension for groovy type and
also support for <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> manifests and
templates.</p>

<p><code>bash puppet types
--type-add=groovy=.gsp
--type-set=puppet=.pp,.erb
</code></p>

<h1>Fishing the Shell</h1>

<p>Lots of friends call me crazy because I invest time in
<a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and use it as much as I can. Also because
I left behind "rich" IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. But come on, you
are a senior developer and you should be able to laugh on any IDE's
face. Even if you were coding Java.</p>

<p>But ok, I'm here to talk about <a href="http://fishshell.com/">Fish Shell</a>. This
is my most recent acquisition. Scripting it is
easy like candy. Check the
<a href="http://fishshell.com/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I've added <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulosuzart/5614350">few scripts to</a> easy connect to a bunch of machines I have to
everyday. And adding some color for git is also easy, check <a href="http://zogovic.com/post/37906589287/showing-git-branch-in-fish-shell-prompt">this
post</a>.</p>

<p>Well, hope you enjoy the tool set. Any news I'll let you know. Thanks
for reading.</p>
